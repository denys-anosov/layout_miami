# Miami landing page

This is my first landing page. The aim was to stick to the mockup as much as possible while carrying out the principles of 
responsive design and BEM methodology.
The page was tested to behave correctly on multiple screen sizes and resolutions.

# Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS with SASS preprocessor (SCSS)
- BEM methodology
- JavaScript

# Mockup

You can find the page mockup [here](https://www.figma.com/file/nHz8bflIwJaWP3P99vKTH5/miami_home_new?node-id=16033%3A3).
